//program goals: creates 3-4 videos, sets the appropriate values, and for each one, add a list of 3-4 comments (with commenter's name and text).  Put each video in a list.  (me: so a list of Video instances).
//the program then iterates through the list of videos and for each one, display the title, author, length, number of comments (from the method) and then list out all of the comments  for that video. Repeat this display for each video in the list.
